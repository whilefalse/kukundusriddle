BANQUO 	How goes the night, boy?	 <br/>
FLEANCE 	The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.	 <br/>
BANQUO 	And she goes down at twelve.	 <br/>
FLEANCE 	I take't, 'tis later, sir.	<br/> 
BANQUO 	Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;	<br/> 
 	Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.	 <br/>
 	A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,	 <br/>
 	And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,	 <br/>
 	Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature	 <br/>
 	Gives way to in repose!	 <br/>
 	Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch	 <br/>
 	Give me my sword.	 <br/>
 	Who's there?	 <br/>
MACBETH 	A friend.	 <br/>
BANQUO 	What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:	 <br/>
 	He hath been in unusual pleasure, and	 <br/>
 	Sent forth great largess to your offices.	 <br/>
 	This diamond he greets your wife withal,	 <br/>
 	By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up	 <br/>
 	In measureless content.	 <br/>
MACBETH 	Being unprepared <br/>
Our will became the servant to defect <br/>
Which else should free have wrought.	 <br/>
BANQUO 	All's well.	 <br/>
 	I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:	 <br/>
 	To you they have show'd some truth.	 <br/>
MACBETH 	I think not of them:	 <br/>
 	Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,	 <br/>
 	We would spend it in some words upon that business,	<br/> 
 	If you would grant the time.	 <br/>
BANQUO 	At your kind'st leisure.	 <br/>
MACBETH 	If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,	 <br/>
 	It shall make honour for you.	 <br/>
BANQUO 	So I lose none	 <br/>
 	In seeking to augment it, but still keep	 <br/>
 	My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,	 <br/>
 	I shall be counsell'd.	 <br/>
MACBETH 	Good repose the while!	 <br/>
BANQUO 	Thanks, sir: the like to you!	 <br/>
 	Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE	 <br/>
MACBETH 	Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,	<br/> 
 	She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.	 <br/>
 	Exit Servant	 <br/>
 	Is this a dagger which I see before me,	 <br/>
 	The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.	<br/> 
 	I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.	 <br/>
 	Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible	 <br/>
 	To feeling as to sight? or art thou but	 <br/>
 	A dagger of the mind, a false creation,	 <br/>
 	Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?	 <br/>
 	I see thee yet, in form as palpable	 <br/>
 	As this which now I draw.	 <br/>
 	Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;	 <br/>
 	And such an instrument I was to use.	 <br/>
 	Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,	<br/> 
 	Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,	 <br/>
 	And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,	 <br/>
 	Which was not so before. There's no such thing:	 <br/>
 	It is the bloody business which informs	 <br/>
 	Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld	 <br/>
 	Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse	 <br/>
 	The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates	 <br/>
 	Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder, <br/>
