Welcome to Kukundu's riddle.

<p>
<br><br>
<b>If you're new to this malarky, here's how it works:</b><br><br>

1) The riddle consists of levels (currently 20 and growing fast!). At each level you
need to find a word.<br><br>

2) To get to the next level, you need to replace <i>whatever.htm</i> with <i>your-answer.htm</i> in
the title bar at the top of your browser.<br><br>

3) There are hints all over the shop. Each level has a picture, a title, and/or clues in the
source code. Make sure you check everywhere to get all the clues!<br><br>

4) Googling will come in very handy, and in a lot of cases it's necessary to find
the answer. The World Wide Web is a great thing you know.<br><br>

5) Some levels sport a kukundu special google search bar. These levels will most proabably require
googling (unless you're some sort of genius). Levels without the toolbar may or may not
require googling. There won't be no hints in the source for the google bar, so don't
go mooching about that!<br><br>

6) Make a note of your answers! You never know when they'll come in handy.<br><br>

7) Thats about it. As you work your way through the levels, you'll learn new techniques
and ideas that will help you later on.<br><br>
8) To start, you'll need to look for a clue in one of the places mentioned above!<br><br>
9) Enjoy!!
