Hints
</h1>
<P>
Because we're really nice, we thought we'd help you get going.
<br/>
Here are some hints for the first 10 levels. But after that, you're on your own!
<br/><br/><br/>
<b>Level 0 (Start page)</b><br/>
Look in the source of the welcome page. It will tell you where to go!
<br/><br/>
<b>Level 1</b><br/>
What would be your first answer to this question, had you not seen the pic?
<br/><br/>
<b>Level 2</b><br/>
Convert the symbols to a word. What langauge are you looking at?
<br/><br/>
<b>Level 3</b><br/>
Decode the message and the title. Then look in the source and apply!
<br/><br/>
<b>Level 4</b><br/>
Scroll down and look closely. Very closely!
<br/><br/>
<b>Level 5</b><br/>
Google will be handy here! Find what 10-9 means given the title.
<br/><br/>
<b>Level 6</b><br/>
Type what you see! Once you get the second page check the source and google the clue.
<br/><br/>
<b>Level 7</b><br/>
An extension eh? Look in the source, find the odd letters and apply!
<br/><br/>
<b>Level 8</b><br/>
Look at all the clues. What do you think those are flags of? Take the first letter of each.
<br/><br/>
<b>Level 9</b><br/>
Look closely at the title and get the odd letters. Apply to the image filename.
<br/><br/>
<b>Level 10</b><br/>
Google the image name. Those codes at the bottom spell a word!
<br/><br/>
